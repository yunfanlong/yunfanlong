Searching through past course websites, syllabi, cheatsheets, and other sources, such as scripts, to monitor seats on WebReg and enroll in classes was consuming an uncountable amount of my time. This page serves as a central location to store all of my resources at UCSD, benefiting everyone who is looking for the same information.


## Websites


**WebReg Scripts**  
This is a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ewang2002/webweg) that allows you to do lots of things on WebReg. It can help you monitor available seats for specific classes, enroll instantly when it is your appointment time, and more.


**IA System**  
This is the [IA System](https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/ASES/Default.aspx), where you can find open positions for academic student employee (TA/Tutor) jobs, your past evaluations, and information on your past assignments. This link has never been connected to any of the UCSD pages I have visited.







## Cheatsheets

I am not particularly good at creating cheatsheets as I tend to be lazy. However, I have friends who are experts in this area.


**DSC 80**

This **[cheatsheet](../assets/pdfs/cheatsheet/dsc80_cs.pdf)** was developed by [Xiaoyue](https://dpwxy.github.io/xiaoyuewang15.github.io/). It contains **everything** from the DSC 80 lectures that you need to know to get an A+. If you have a solid background, you could theoretically study the entire course in one day.

**DSC 102**

This **[cheatsheet](../assets/pdfs/cheatsheet/dsc102_cs.pdf)** was developed by [Xiaoyue](https://dpwxy.github.io/xiaoyuewang15.github.io/) and [Yi](https://jerryli1019.github.io/jerryliyi.github.io/). This has been proven to potentially help you score the second highest in the class without needing to study at all!
