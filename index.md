## About Me💯

Hello! My name is **Weiyue Li (李威岳)**. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), pursuing triple majors in Data Science (BS), Applied Mathematics (BS), and Economics (BA). I am expected graduate in March 2024.

I primarily center my research around machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML). I place particular emphasis on <u>large language models</u>, <u>computer vision</u>, and the <u>practical aspects of domain generalization and transfer</u> — especially at their intersections. Leveraging my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis, I've made significant contributions to various research and internship projects in the healthcare industry.

I'm interning at Professor [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/)'s Machine Learning, Perception, and Cognition Lab (mlPC), where I'm working on LLM-related (VLM and LLM) projects under the mentorship of Dr. [Yifan Xu](https://yfxu.com/). I am also fortunate to receive guidance from Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/), Professor [Mingxiong Huang](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/node/516), and Dr. [Ganz Chockalingam](https://pdel.ucsd.edu/people/research-affiliates/ganz-chockalingam.html) for other AI/ML application-based research projects. Prior to this, I had the privilege of working in Professor [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)'s Computational Neurobiology Laboratory ([CNL](https://cnl.salk.edu/)) on a healthcare deep learning project, where Dr. [Margot Wagner](https://www.margotwagner.com/) was my mentor. Learn more at [Research](/research).

Beyond research, I have a deep passion for education. As an 18-time undergraduate teaching assistant, I've supported 12 courses across the Computer Science and Engineering, Data Science, Economics, and Mathematics departments, aiding over 3,000 students in their academic journeys. Collaborating with 18 faculty members, I've sought to elevate the course experiences for UCSD students. In my teaching endeavors, I am primarily mentored by [Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/), Dr. [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/), and Professor [Tauhidur Rahman](https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/).

### To friends at UCSD🔱

Growing up at UCSD, I have met many upperclassmen who have helped me become who I am today. If you are an undergraduate student at UCSD looking for **advice and resources**, please see [here](/advice).
